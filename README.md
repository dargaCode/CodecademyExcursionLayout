# Excursion Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

Another project working to match <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/excursion/index.html">codecademy's example layout</a>.

The site itself is pretty simple. The main challenges were getting the background video to work and general responsiveness.

The scenery in that video is really pretty, but damn am I sick of watching it haha.
