# Excursion Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

Another project working to match codecademy's example layout.

The site itself is pretty simple. The main challenges were getting the background video to work and general responsiveness.

The scenery in that video is really pretty, but damn am I sick of watching it haha.
